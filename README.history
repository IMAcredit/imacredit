8/31/2014 - Started coin for "The Crypto Void" as a replacement for a defunct coin previously 
            planned.  Coin basis is IMAcredit, with the intention of selecting an N that will 
	    require the better part of 1GB of memory per CPU thread.
12/17/2014 - added 3rd checkpoint and set minimum protocol to prevent stale nodes from blocking
            new user syncs.  Will establish bridge-node for their continual operation.
	    Windows binary updated to current library releases.
